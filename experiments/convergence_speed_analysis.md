# Convergence Speed Analysis

## 1. What is Convergence Speed?

Convergence speed is a critical performance metric that quantifies how quickly an optimization algorithm reaches a target level of solution quality. It measures the computational efficiency of an algorithm by determining the percentage of the total evaluation budget required to achieve a specific performance threshold.

In optimization research, convergence speed is particularly important because it directly relates to:
- **Computational efficiency**: How quickly an algorithm finds good solutions
- **Resource utilization**: Whether an algorithm uses evaluation budget effectively
- **Practical applicability**: Real-world problems often have limited computational budgets
- **Algorithm comparison**: Provides fair comparison across different optimization methods

For this study, convergence speed is defined as the percentage of evaluations needed to reach 95% of the final improvement achieved by the algorithm. This definition captures how efficiently an algorithm progresses toward its best solution.

## 2. Formula and Mathematical Explanation

The convergence speed is calculated using the following formula:

```
Convergence Speed = (evaluations_to_target / max_evaluations) × 100%
```

Where:
- **evaluations_to_target**: Number of evaluations required to reach 95% of final improvement
- **max_evaluations**: Total evaluation budget allocated to the algorithm

### Mathematical Derivation:

1. **Target Value Calculation**:
   ```
   target_value = initial_value - 0.95 × (initial_value - final_value)
   ```

2. **Convergence Detection**:
   ```
   For each evaluation i:
       if objective_value[i] ≤ target_value:
           convergence_evaluations = i + 1
           break
   ```

3. **Speed Calculation**:
   ```
   convergence_speed = (convergence_evaluations / max_evaluations) × 100%
   ```

### Interpretation:
- **0-20%**: Very fast convergence (excellent efficiency)
- **20-50%**: Fast convergence (good efficiency)
- **50-80%**: Moderate convergence (acceptable efficiency)
- **80-100%**: Slow convergence (poor efficiency)
- **100%**: No convergence within budget (inefficient)

### Why 95% Threshold?
The 95% threshold provides a good balance between:
- Capturing meaningful progress (not just first improvement)
- Avoiding noise from final refinements
- Providing consistent comparison across algorithms
- Reflecting practical optimization scenarios

## 3. Experimental Design

### Evaluation Budget Analysis:
To comprehensively analyze convergence speed, we conduct experiments with varying computational budgets:

- **10 evaluations**: Ultra-limited budget (immediate convergence assessment)
- **40 evaluations**: Low budget (early convergence patterns)
- **80 evaluations**: Medium budget (convergence efficiency)
- **120 evaluations**: High budget (extensive convergence analysis)
- **200 evaluations**: Full budget (complete convergence behavior)

### Test Functions:
Using COCO/BBOB benchmark suite for standardized evaluation:
- **Function 1 (Sphere)**: Unimodal function (fast convergence expected)
- **Function 8 (Rosenbrock)**: Valley-shaped function (moderate convergence)
- **Function 23 (Katsuura)**: Multimodal function (slower convergence expected)

### Algorithm Comparison:
- **AFN**: Surrogate-based method with adaptive fidelity
- **GA**: Genetic algorithm with population evolution
- **PSO**: Particle swarm with velocity updates
- **ACO**: Ant colony with pheromone trails

### Experimental Parameters:
- **Dimensions**: 2D, 5D, 10D, 20D (scalability analysis)
- **Independent runs**: 15 runs per configuration
- **Random initialization**: Fixed seeds for reproducibility
- **Convergence criterion**: 95% of final improvement
