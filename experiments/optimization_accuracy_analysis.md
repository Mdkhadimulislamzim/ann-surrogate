# Optimization Accuracy Analysis

## 1. What is Optimization Accuracy?

Optimization accuracy is a fundamental metric that quantifies how close an optimization algorithm gets to the global optimum of a given objective function. It measures the effectiveness of an algorithm in finding high-quality solutions relative to the best possible solution (global optimum) for the problem.

In the context of continuous optimization, this metric is particularly important because it directly reflects the algorithm's ability to:
- Navigate complex search landscapes
- Avoid getting trapped in local optima
- Converge to regions containing the global optimum
- Maintain solution quality across different problem instances

For minimization problems, optimization accuracy represents the percentage of improvement achieved from the initial solution to the final solution, relative to the total possible improvement (from initial to global optimum).

## 2. Formula and Mathematical Explanation

The optimization accuracy is calculated using the following formula:

```
Optimization Accuracy = 100 Ã— (1 - (f_final - f_optimum) / (f_initial - f_optimum))
```

Where:
- **f_final**: The best objective function value found by the algorithm
- **f_optimum**: The global optimum value (typically 0 for BBOB functions)
- **f_initial**: The initial objective function value at the start of optimization

### Mathematical Interpretation:

1. **Numerator (f_final - f_optimum)**: Represents the remaining gap between the final solution and the global optimum
2. **Denominator (f_initial - f_optimum)**: Represents the total possible improvement from initial to optimal
3. **Ratio**: Shows what fraction of the total improvement has been achieved
4. **Percentage**: Converted to percentage for intuitive interpretation

### Range and Interpretation:
- **100%**: Perfect accuracy (found the global optimum exactly)
- **90-99%**: Excellent performance (very close to optimum)
- **70-89%**: Good performance (reasonable proximity to optimum)
- **50-69%**: Moderate performance (some improvement achieved)
- **0-49%**: Poor performance (minimal improvement or degradation)

## 3. Experimental Design

### Problem Suite:
We evaluate optimization accuracy using the COCO/BBOB benchmark suite, which provides standardized test functions widely recognized in the optimization community:

- **Function 1 (Sphere)**: Unimodal, separable function
- **Function 8 (Rosenbrock)**: Non-separable, valley-shaped function  
- **Function 23 (Katsuura)**: Highly multimodal, non-separable function

### Algorithm Comparison:
We compare four optimization algorithms:
- **AFN (Adaptive Fidelity Nexus)**: Our proposed surrogate-based method
- **GA (Genetic Algorithm)**: Population-based evolutionary approach
- **PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization)**: Swarm intelligence method
- **ACO (Ant Colony Optimization)**: Metaheuristic inspired by ant behavior

### Evaluation Budget Analysis:
To understand how optimization accuracy evolves with computational resources, we conduct experiments with varying evaluation budgets:

- **10 evaluations**: Very limited budget (early termination)
- **40 evaluations**: Low budget (quick assessment)
- **80 evaluations**: Medium budget (moderate exploration)
- **120 evaluations**: High budget (extensive search)
- **200 evaluations**: Full budget (comprehensive optimization)

### Experimental Setup:
- **Dimensions**: 2D, 5D, 10D, 20D
- **Runs per configuration**: 15 independent runs
- **Random seeds**: Fixed for reproducibility
- **Bounds**: Function-specific bounds from BBOB suite
