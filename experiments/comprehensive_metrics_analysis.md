# Comprehensive Metrics Analysis: AFN vs Traditional Optimization Algorithms

## 1. Overview of Performance Metrics

In optimization research, comprehensive evaluation requires multiple performance metrics that capture different aspects of algorithm behavior. This analysis examines five critical metrics that provide a complete picture of optimization algorithm performance:

1. **Optimization Accuracy**: Solution quality relative to global optimum
2. **Convergence Speed**: Computational efficiency in reaching target performance
3. **Resource Utilization**: Effective use of evaluation budget
4. **Exploitation Balance**: Exploration vs exploitation strategy effectiveness
5. **Robustness**: Consistency and reliability across multiple runs

Together, these metrics provide a holistic evaluation framework that addresses both solution quality and computational efficiency, essential for practical optimization applications.

## 2. Mathematical Formulations

### 2.1 Optimization Accuracy
```
Accuracy = 100 × (1 - (f_final - f_optimum) / (f_initial - f_optimum))
```
**Purpose**: Measures how close the algorithm gets to the global optimum.

### 2.2 Convergence Speed
```
Convergence Speed = (evaluations_to_95% / max_evaluations) × 100%
```
**Purpose**: Quantifies how quickly the algorithm reaches 95% of its final improvement.

### 2.3 Resource Utilization
```
Resource Utilization = (evaluations_used / max_evaluations) × 100%
```
**Purpose**: Measures how effectively the algorithm uses its computational budget.

### 2.4 Exploitation Balance
```
Exploitation Balance = (E / (E + R)) × 100%
```
Where E = exploitation contribution, R = exploration contribution
**Purpose**: Analyzes the balance between local refinement and global exploration.

### 2.5 Robustness
```
Robustness = (1 - (std_deviation / mean_value)) × 100%
```
**Purpose**: Measures consistency across multiple independent runs.
